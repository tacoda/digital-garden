Object-Oriented Design
======================

The SOLID acronym, coined by Michael Feathers and popularized by Robert Martin, represents five of the most well known principles of object-oriented design: Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. Other principles include Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas’s DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and the Law of Demeter (LoD) from the Demeter project at Northeastern University.

The trick to getting the most bang for your design buck is to acquire an under- standing of the theories of design and to apply these theories appropriately, at the right time, and in the right amounts. Design relies on your ability to translate theory into practice.
