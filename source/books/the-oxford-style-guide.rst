Introduction
============

Objectives of the style guide
-----------------------------

There are three main objectives in writing this style guide:

- to provide an all-purpose guide to consistent presentation for University
staff in written communications
- to review the guide at least once a year, ensuring that it properly reflects
modern usage and is fit for purpose, and to update it as required
- as part of the review process, to invite proposals from members of the
University who disagree with any existing guidance, and to act as an
arbiter on those cases.

What is/is not included in the style guide
------------------------------------------

The guide does not tell you how to write. We aim to help you write correctly,
and to encourage consistency across the University’s written communications.

Quick reference guide
---------------------

***The general rule**

If there are multiple (correct) ways of doing something, choose the one which
uses the least space and the least ink. For instance:

- close up spaces and don’t use full stops in abbreviations (eg 6pm)
- use lower case wherever possible
- only write out numbers up to ten and use figures for 11 onwards.

## Abbreviations, Contractions, and Acronyms

**General rule**

Don’t use full stops after any abbreviations, contractions or acronyms and
close up space between letters.

**Abbreviations**

These are formed by omitting letters from the end of a word.

> am, pm

**Contractions**

These are formed by omitting letters from the middle of a word.

> Mr, Dr, St

**Acronyms**

These are formed from the initial letters of words (whether the result is
pronounceable as a word or as a series of letters) and should be written
as a single string of upper-case letters.

> BBC, MA, PDF

When using an acronym that may be unfamiliar to your readers, spell it out
in full the first time it is mentioned, with the acronym following in brackets;
thereafter, use the acronym alone.

> The decision was made by the Planning and Resource Allocation Committee (PRAC). There are several meetings of PRAC every term.

Specific Abbreviations
----------------------

**ampersands**

Ampersands should only be used if they are part of official titles or names.
Otherwise, spell out ‘and’.

**people’s initials**

Use a space to separate each initial.

**measurements**

When discussing large numbers in text, it is fine to use k/m/bn as shorter
ways of spelling out 1,000/1,000,000/1,000,000,000 (or writing out ‘one
thousand’/‘one million’/‘one billion’), as long as you are consistent throughout
the document. For multiple millions/billions you can use a mixture of words and
numbers (eg 7 million, 8bn); again, ensure you are consistent throughout.

**Latin abbreviations**

If you are using Latin abbreviations, make sure you know what they mean and
when to use them. Do not use full stops after them and don't italicise them.

_etc [et cetera]_ – means ‘and the rest’; use to indicate the continuation of a list

> Oxford offers many language courses: Russian, French, Spanish etc
> [the list could continue with the other language courses offered].

_eg [exempli gratia]_ – means ‘for example’ or ‘such as’; use with examples which
are not exhaustive (and do not follow with a comma)

> Oxford offers many language courses, eg Russian, French, Spanish
> [those are some, but not all, of the language courses offered].

_ie [id est]_ – means ‘that is’; use with definitions or lists which are exhaustive (and do not follow with a comma)

> Catch a Blackbird Leys bus, ie numbers 1, 5 or 12
> [those are the only buses which go to Blackbird Leys].

_ibid [ibidem]_ – means ‘in the same place’; use when making a subsequent
reference/citation to a publication or other source mentioned in the
immediately preceding note (ie no references to anything else have appeared
in between)

> For a fuller explanation of telepathy, see Brown [Speaking with the
> Mind, Chicago (1945) p125]; Brown also gives further information on
> cats and telepathy [ibid, p229].

Capitalization
==============

**General rule**

Do **not** use a capital letter unless it is absolutely required.

## Numbers

**How to write numbers**

Spell out whole-number words for one to ten; use figures for numbers
above ten.

> ✔ There were two people in the queue ahead of me, and six behind me.
>
> ✔ I need to buy Christmas presents for 12 people this year.

Use a combination of a figure and a word for very large round numbers (such as multiple millions/billions etc), or abbreviate it to ‘m’, ‘bn’ etc.

> ✔ The population of the earth is now 7 billion people.
>
> ✔ The population of the earth is now 7bn people.
>
> ✔ The budget came in at just under £2m.

If there are a lot of figures in a paragraph or text, some above ten and some below, use figures throughout to allow easy comparison by readers.

> ✔ There were 2 people in the queue ahead of me, and 22 behind me.
>
> ✔ The queues for other advisors had 10, 3 and 12 people.

Spell out words for ‘first’, ‘second’ and so on up to and including ‘tenth’; use numbers and ‘st’/ ‘nd’/ ‘rd’/ ‘th’ for larger ordinal numbers. Don’t use superscript (to prevent problems with line spacing).

> ✔ She was the first person from her school to get a place at Oxford.
>
> ✔ He got an upper second, to his relief.
>
> ❌ She got a 3rd class degree.
>
> ✔ The 17th president of the United States was Andrew Johnson.

Always use figures and symbols for percentages, measurements and currency. Use commas to punctuate large numbers.

> ✔ Question 12 is worth 10% of the available marks.
>
> ❌ 20 per cent of commuters use their cars.
>
> ✔ The average height of a woman in the UK is 1.61m.
>
> ✔ The cost, at £5.99, was less than their overall budget of £50.
>
> ✔ The population of New York City is estimated to be 8,008,278.

**Times**

Use either the 12- or 24-hour clock - not both in the same text. The 12-hour clock uses a full stop between the hours and minutes; the 24-hour clock uses a colon and omits am/pm.

> ✔ The lecture starts at 11.30am and ends at 1pm.
>
> ✔ The lecture starts at 11:30 and ends at 13:00.
>
> ❌  The lecture starts at 11.30am and ends at 13:00.
>
> ❌  The lecture starts at 16:00pm.

Use ‘noon’ or ‘midnight’ instead of ‘12’, ‘12 noon’ or ‘12 midnight’.

> ✔ The closing date for applications is noon on 12 July.

If using the 12-hour clock, don’t use additional ‘.00’ for times on the hour, and close up space between the number and the ‘am’ or ‘pm’.

> ✔ The lecture starts at 9am.
>
> ✔ The lecture starts at 11.30am and ends at 1pm.
>
> ❌ The lecture starts at 9.00am.
>
> ❌ The lecture starts at 9 am.

**Dates**

Always put the date before the month.

> ✔ Easter this year is on 13 April.
>
> ❌ Easter this year is on April 13.

Don’t use ‘th’ etc with dates – just the number and month – and never precede the number with ‘the’.

> ✔ Easter this year is on 13 April.
>
> ❌ 11th November is Armistice Day.
>
> ❌ 
Armistice Day is on the 11 November.

Use days with dates only for emphasis or the avoidance of confusion/ambiguity.

> ✔ The wedding is on 30 December.
>
> ❌ The wedding is on Saturday 20 December.
>
> ✔ The Modern Superstitions conference is on Friday 13 April.
